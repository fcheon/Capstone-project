## Capstone Project
I have reverted back to the home mortgage pricing index.


## Problem to solve.
Analyzing, then finding out which income/race/gender receives higher chance for an approval of mortgage loan. 

## Target Market
My target client would be the mortgage loaning banks/companies to learn how to educate their potential clients on what they need to improve to increase their approval chances.


## Choice of data
Using a data set from Kaggle -cannot find the link anymore. Attached the 7z file on github

## My approach
1. Finding a good category to work with. State may be too wide? or just good enough?
2. Organizing the useful data, such has co applicant, income, etc
3. creating an average or median line within scatter point to see the robust outcome

## Deliverables
Using various plots to show multiple points of view on the approval rates.
