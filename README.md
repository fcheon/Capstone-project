# Start Thinking About Your Capstone Project
#The data set already exists and is relatively easy for you to obtain.
#The data is sufficiently rich in information and features to answer the main question you have proposed in your project.
#The outcome of your analysis has a realistic impact i.e., it clearly helps your real or hypothetical client make better decisions, or do something differently.
